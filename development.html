                        Physical development is actively encouraged at Ciara&rsquo;s Tots Private Day Nursery and to reinforce the importance of &lsquo;exercise&rsquo; we have deployed a &lsquo;sport specific&rsquo; programme for our children. The &lsquo;Playmakers&rsquo; programme is tailored towards each stage of the child&rsquo;s physical and mental development, working specifically around five main topics (balance, co-ordination, ball skills, target-based games and communication). The overall programme is designed to allow children to express themselves freely as individuals whilst participating in a group environment.<br /><br />Photographs of the children having fun following the programmes are displayed in the <a href="gallery.html">Gallery</a> section.
