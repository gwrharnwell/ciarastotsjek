                        Physical development is actively encouraged at Ciara’s Tots Private Day Nursery and to reinforce the importance of ‘exercise’ we have deployed a ‘sport specific’ programme for our children.  The ‘Playmakers’ programme is tailored towards each stage of the child’s physical and mental development, working specifically around five main topics (balance, co-ordination, ball skills, target-based games and communication).  The overall programme is designed to allow children to express themselves freely as individuals whilst participating in a group environment.
                        <br><br>
Photographs of the children having fun following the programmes are displayed in the <a href="#">Gallery</a> section.
