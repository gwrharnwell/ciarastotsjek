                        Ciara’s Tots Private Day Nursery is a small ‘family run’ nursery situated in Chorlton-On-Medlock. We are OFSTED registered
                        and offer an excellent childcare provision in a safe, secure, welcoming and attractive environment.
                        CCTV has also been installed for added security. The nursery was purpose built in July 2003, so all
                        fittings are new.
                    </p>

                        We carefully select our staff team not only for their professional childcare qualifications and experience, but also for
                        their personal qualities, their commitment to provide each child with quality care, and their continuing
                        enthusiasm to develop their skills through further training.

                Our ‘mission statement’ and ‘nursery ethos’ is to create a nurturing environment that is happy for both the children and
                staff. Our fundamental aim is to care for the children and then to facilatate learning. Happy children equates
                to a happy nursery and this is what Ciara’s Tots stands for.
